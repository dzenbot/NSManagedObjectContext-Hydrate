You probably tried different techniques like using Python or Ruby scripts, but it should be easier than that!<br><br>\r\nThis category class helps you by parsing and saving automagically every object from a JSON or CSV data structure into a persistent store with no effort.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAvailable in [Cocoa Pods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=NSManagedObjectContext-Hydrate)\r\n```\r\npod 'NSManagedObjectContext-Hydrate', '~> 1.0.2'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### Step 1\r\n```\r\nImport \"NSManagedObjectContext+Hydrate.h\" to your Application Delegate class.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\n```\r\nImport Apple's CoreData framework.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 3\r\nAfter initialising your Managed Object Context, you are ready to preload your JSON content into the store.\r\nCall the following method:\r\n```\r\nNSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"persons\" ofType:@\"json\"];\r\nNSDictionary *attributes = @{@\"firstName\":@\"first_name\", @\"lastName\":@\"last_name\", @\"age\":@\"age\", @\"height\":@\"height\", @\"weight\":@\"weight\"};\r\n\r\n[_managedObjectContext hydrateStoreWithJSONAtPath:path attributeMappings:attributes forEntityName:@\"Person\"];\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr your CSV content:\r\n```\r\nNSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"persons\" ofType:@\"csv\"];\r\nNSDictionary *attributes = @{@\"firstName\":@\"first_name\", @\"lastName\":@\"last_name\", @\"age\":@\"age\", @\"height\":@\"height\", @\"weight\":@\"weight\"};\r\n\r\n[_managedObjectContext hydrateStoreWithCSVAtPath:path attributeMappings:attributes forEntityName:@\"Person\"];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sample project\r\nTake a look into the sample project.
