NSManagedObjectContext-Hydrate
==============================

Have you ever wanted to preload an application's CoreData store?<br>
If you did, you must know then that it's a real painful and undocumented process. You probably tried different techniques like using Python or Ruby scripts, but it should be easier than that!<br><br>
This category class intends to preload, parse and save automagically every object from a JSON data structure into a persistent store with no effort.

## How to use

### Step 1
```
Import "NSManagedObjectContext+Hydrate.h" to your Application Delegate class.
```

### Step 2
```
Import Apple's CoreData framework.
```

### Step 3
After initialising your Managed Object Context, you are ready to preload your JSON content into the store.
Call the following method:
```
NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Persons" ofType:@"json"];
[_managedObjectContext hydrateStoreWithJSONAtPath:path forEntityName:@"Person"];
```

### Sample project
